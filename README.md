## Procedural Generation of Interactive 3D Terrain

A Unity project developed by a 3-person team focused on procedurally generating and modifying terrain. The project provides tools to generate terrain surface and shape it using various tools, including height map editing and hydraulic erosion simulation. It also allows the generation of the environment, including trees, bushes and rocks.

**Features:** procedural terrain generation using the Marching Cubes algorithm and 2D/3D Perlin noise, a height map editor, various terrain modification tools, hydraulic erosion simulation, environment generation, CPU multithreading
